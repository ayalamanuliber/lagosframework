# Hollywood's New Formula - Script Framework

## Opening Hook
[Scene: Pedro in a makeshift "lab kitchen" - regular kitchen with random tech/science equipment scattered around. Wearing a white lab coat over his usual outfit, plus a chef's apron that says "Kiss the Libertarian". Making mate with absurdly precise measurements]

PEDRO: *using scientific pipette to add water to mate* "The perfect formula requires precise measurements..." 

[Woke Detector beeps softly in background]

PEDRO: *to camera, suddenly aware* "Oh! Didn't see you there. I was just working on my latest experiment. You see, lately I've been studying Hollywood's remake formula, and..." *checks beaker of mate* "...like any good formula, it's all about the ingredients."

[Pulls out comically large notebook labeled "CLASSIFIED: HOLLYWOOD FORMULA" with fake coffee stains and "TOP SECRET" stamps]

PEDRO: "And after months of research..." *dramatic pause, sips mate with pinky up* "I've cracked the code."

[Woke Detector beeps aggressively]

PEDRO: "What? No, that's not a sexist- I'm literally in a kitchen doing science! Ay, shut up!" *to camera, straightening lab coat* "As I was saying... let me show you what I've discovered."

[Dramatic transition: Pedro "accidentally" knocks over his beaker of mate, but instead of cleaning it, he freezes - looks at camera with sudden realization]

PEDRO: "Wait... that's it! *grabs lab coat dramatically* Just like this spill, Hollywood is making a mess of everything! And unlike this mate..." *gestures at spill while backing away* "...some things can't be cleaned up."

[Transition through spilled mate puddle ripple effect to regular set, Pedro now in his usual setup but still wearing the lab coat over his normal clothes]

## The Setup
[Quick montage: Recent remakes with Detector readings overlaid like scientific data. Each reading gets worse, displayed like a heart monitor flatlining]

PEDRO: *still in lab coat* "For months, I've been analyzing every remake. Every. Single. One." *eye twitches slightly* "And let me tell you... it's been hell."

[Cuts to Pedro surrounded by screens showing remake clips, Detector readings everywhere, red string connecting photos on a wall like a conspiracy board]

PEDRO: "At first, I thought I was going crazy. *gestures at wall* But then I saw it. The pattern. The formula. The absolute MADNESS of it all!"

[Dramatic zoom on notebook as he slams it on desk]

## The Formula Breakdown
[Pedro approaches whiteboard, but it's already filled with crazy calculations and arrows]

PEDRO: *erases frantically* "Let me break this down for the people in the back... and the Hollywood executives who clearly need remedial math."

[Pedro stares at conspiracy board, then suddenly starts laughing]

PEDRO: *rips down some papers* "You know what's actually funny? I've been making this WAY more complicated than it is." 

[Wipes whiteboard clean in one swipe]

PEDRO: "The real formula? *draws simple flowchart* Twitter activists with blue hair complain about something → Studios panic → Hire those SAME activists as 'consultants' → Movie gets butchered → Movie fails → They blame the audience."

[Detector beeping steadily]

PEDRO: "And the best part? *starts drawing stick figures with blue hair* These people? They don't even watch the movies! They just move on to complain about the next thing!"

[Quick cut montage of Twitter posts with blue-haired avatars, each complaining about different movies]

PEDRO: "It's like having a food critic who's never eaten food tell the chef how to cook! *pauses* Actually..." *looks back at lab kitchen setup* "...that explains the mess."

## The Bingo Card Reveal
[Pulls out Bingo card, but now it's simpler - just photos of blue-haired Twitter avatars and their common phrases]
- "Actually, in medieval times..."
- "Problematic™"
- "Do better"
- "Unpacking this"
- "This ain't it chief"

PEDRO: *checking boxes rapidly* "Look how easy this is! It's the same people! The same complaints! The same-" *stops suddenly as mom calls*

## The Mom Interruption
[Phone rings during serious point about princesses]

PEDRO: "Mama, not now, I'm in the middle of- yes, I'm drinking water. No, I'm not just having mate all day... *covers phone* I'll be right back."

[Jump cut to Pedro looking slightly chastised]

PEDRO: "So... where was I? Ah yes, the DESTRUCTION OF CINEMA!"

## The Industry Explanation
[Pulls out flow chart]

PEDRO: "It's simple. Market research says audiences want strong characters. But instead of writing ACTUAL strong characters, they just..." 

[Detector going crazy]

PEDRO: "...remove any trace of humanity from them. *to Detector* Yes, YES, I KNOW! That's the POINT I'm making!"

## The Real Problem
[Calmer, more serious tone]

PEDRO: "Look, this isn't about being 'anti-woke'. It's about being anti-lazy. These stories were already perfect. They had messages, they had growth, they had..."

[Picks up original Snow White poster]

PEDRO: "...heart. But now? *pulls out Bingo card again, every square filled* Now we just have a checklist."

## The Conclusion
[Back at desk, lab coat now hanging loose, mate almost empty]

PEDRO: "But you know what's interesting? *leans forward* Something's changing."

[Shows Twitter timeline, but now with different responses]

PEDRO: "See, those blue-haired activists? They're not the only ones talking anymore. The silent majority? Not so silent these days."

[Montage: Clips of failed "woke" movies vs successful traditional ones]

PEDRO: "Studios are finally learning that Twitter isn't real life. That those loud voices? They're just that - loud. But the actual audience?" *picks up Woke Detector* "They're done being quiet."

[Detector starts beeping, but differently - almost like applause]

PEDRO: "Look at the numbers. Every time they try to force this formula..." *gestures at whiteboard* "...it fails. And every time they just tell a good story? *chef's kiss* Éxito total!"

[Standing up, energized]

PEDRO: "The tide is turning, amigos. People are speaking up. The fear of cancelation? It's losing its power. Because here's the thing about formulas..." *picks up mate beaker from earlier* "...when they don't work, you throw them out."

[Dramatically pours out remaining mate]

PEDRO: "And this one?" *rips page from formula notebook* "It's done. Finished. Kaput."

[Detector beeps happily]

PEDRO: "Even my detector agrees! And it never agr-"

[Mom calls again]

PEDRO: *answering quickly* "¡Sí mama, ya voy! *to camera* And that's my cue. But remember..." *puts on sunglasses* "...the real formula? Just tell a good story. The rest is just noise."

[Spanish guitar riff plays, but this time Pedro grins and nods along]

PEDRO: "You know what? I'm keeping the guitar guy."

## End Card
[Quick cuts of upcoming video teases]

PEDRO: "Next time: Why every modern villain is just a girlboss with trauma. And yes..." *pulls out same battered Bingo card, now covered in various marks and coffee stains* "...the card still works. Because guess what? These people? They never change their script."

[Detector beeps in agreement]

PEDRO: *already marking squares* "Oh yeah, I'm pre-marking 'Actually...' and 'Problematic'. Trust me, they ALWAYS say these ones."

[Spanish guitar riff]

PEDRO: *nodding along while marking* "Gracias, guitar guy. You get it."

### Production Notes
- Keep cuts dynamic during formula breakdown
- Zoom in on bingo card squares for emphasis
- Spanish guitar riff should get more elaborate each time
- Mom call should feel natural, not forced
- Detector beeps increase in intensity throughout
- Action figure moment should feel genuinely embarrassed
- End with blooper of Pedro dancing to Spanish guitar
