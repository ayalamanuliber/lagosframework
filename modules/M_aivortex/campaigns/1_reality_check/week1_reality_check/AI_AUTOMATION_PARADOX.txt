I Automated My Job With AI and It Made Me Worse At It - Here's Why

It was 3 AM last Tuesday when I finally cracked it - or so I thought. After my third Red Bull and what felt like my 50th Git commit, I had built what I considered my masterpiece: an AI system that automated our customer feedback analysis. My bleary eyes stared at the terminal as it processed in 12 minutes what usually took me all of Thursday afternoon.

I messaged my team lead right there: "Maya, I think I just 10x'd our feedback process!" (She wasn't awake, obviously. I really need to work on my work-life boundaries.)

But here's the thing about automation wins - sometimes they're like those Instagram-perfect breakfast photos. They look amazing until you see the kitchen mess behind the scenes.

Fast forward three weeks. I'm sitting in our monthly strategy meeting, sweating through my favorite Vortex t-shirt (the one with the coffee stains that won't wash out), when our CEO asks me about the weird spike in "feature request" tags in February's data.

I froze. I had processed that data just yesterday through my shiny new AI system. But I had no clue about the spike. None. Zero. Nada.

That's when it hit me harder than my 3 AM caffeine crash - I had accidentally automated away my own understanding.

The Raw Numbers:
- Old way: 4 painful hours of manual analysis every Thursday
- New AI system: 12 minutes of processing time
- My confidence in explaining trends: Down about 80%
- Number of "um, let me check that" responses in meetings: Up 300%

Here's what I realized: Those mind-numbing Thursday afternoons of manually tagging customer feedback weren't just busy work. They were my crash course in customer psychology. Every frustrated email, every feature request, every bug report - they were building my product intuition one complaint at a time.

My AI system was like having someone summarize a book for you. Sure, you get the plot points, but you miss all the details that make the story stick in your brain.

So I did something that probably sounds insane: I deleted most of my automation code. Not all of it (I'm not completely crazy), but enough to force me to keep my hands dirty with the raw data.

My new system is messier but weirdly more effective:
1. I manually process the first 50 pieces of feedback every week (usually Monday morning, with my actually-good coffee)
2. Let the AI handle the rest, but with me spot-checking random samples
3. Keep a "weird findings" Slack channel where I drop interesting patterns the AI might miss

The results are... well, mixed in the best possible way:
- Processing time: Now about 1.5 hours (still better than 4!)
- My ability to answer random questions in meetings: Actually useful again
- Number of genuine insights that surprised our product team: 3 last month alone
- Times I've had to say "the AI must have miscategorized that": Zero

Look, I still hate spending part of my Monday mornings reading through customer complaints. Sometimes I catch myself staring at my screen thinking "an AI could do this faster." And yeah, it probably could.

But faster isn't always better. Sometimes you need to read that angry all-caps feedback from Steve in accounting to really understand why that new feature isn't working. An AI can count how many times people mention a problem. But it takes a human to feel why it matters.

P.S. I did keep one part of my 3 AM coding masterpiece - an automated alert that tells me when someone writes feedback in all caps. Those are always interesting.
