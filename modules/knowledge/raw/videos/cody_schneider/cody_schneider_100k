[00:00:00] We took Landing Cat from non-existent to 100k ARR in like four weeks. Our job as founders is to scope waves and be like, cool. That one, that looks good.

[00:00:09] This is Cody. After launching a simple Chrome extension, he became obsessed with building online businesses and now has over 20 profitable businesses generating millions in revenue.

[00:00:19] The crazy part is, these businesses are all just simple offerings on top of huge demand, so much so that a small Chrome extension side project still funds his monthly rent today.

[00:00:29] It does around, like on average, around like eight to nine K a month. It is literally a data extraction tool, helps you just like pull data, like basically get it out. During the holidays, it bumps, you know, it'll do like 14 to 15 grand a month, like November, December, January.

[00:00:43] Cody's model is simple. Build businesses on top of rising trends, always backed by data.

[00:00:48] People are buying are like three things. So either they're buying time back, they're buying money back, or they're buying status.

[00:00:54] I'm gonna try a hundred things. We're gonna see that three percent of that worked. I'm gonna put all of our resources, the time, money, and mental energy into those things.

[00:01:02] He continues to quickly launch businesses, and his latest venture just hit 100k annual recurring revenue in only four weeks.

[00:01:09] He shares his exact approach and how others can do the same.

[00:01:12] People are looking for this. Can I build that? All the big bets.

[00:01:17] I flew out to Denver to sit down with him and learn his data-first approach to finding huge business opportunities (without any special skills), all his favorite tools and resources he uses on his own businesses, and his exact playbook he uses to launch successful products in weeks. Let's dive in.

[00:01:33] Cody. Thanks for having us at your house.

[00:01:36] Dude, stoked to have you slash office. So, you do so many interesting things on the internet. Let's just dive right in. Can you talk about how you first made, what was it, 10k MRR in a couple of weeks?

[00:01:47] So, company was called Draft Horse AI. Um, we built that as an internal tool for ourselves initially. Found all these long-tail keywords related to our product, which is called Swell AI. Talking about it in public on Twitter, people were like, hey, I wanna buy that thing. And so, naturally, the capitalist that I am, we're like, cool, we'll have it live in three days. And so we spun it out over a weekend, ended up going viral. Um, there's so many of these now. Like, we rode this initial wave that was happening. Um, and there's actually way better ways to do this now. How we took it to 10k MRR in 30 days. Um, later on, some cold email, later on, some paid ads on top of it. Um, and uh, yeah, that was that was really it.

[00:02:20] You said you were messing around a while ago and built a Chrome extension that still pays your rent today.

[00:02:24] Yeah, totally. Yeah. So, it's in the eCommerce space, so it's it's super cyclical. Um, but it does around, like on average, around like eight to nine K a month. It is literally a data extraction tool, helps you just like pull data, like basically get it out. During the holidays, it bumps, you know, it'll do like 14 to 15 grand a month, like November, December, January.

[00:02:42] Honestly, the first kind of foray into software was really that. And uh, opened my eyes for like, oh, if you have just a small tool that solves a huge problem, it can, you know, people will pay for that. Then you just layer on like funnel and marketing.

[00:02:54] How, how did you like spot that problem?

[00:02:56] Honestly, it was it was my own challenge. So, I was selling a bunch of print-on-demand products um across Etsy, across Amazon, across Redbubble, basically anywhere I could get my greasy hands on. Um, we were we were doing stuff in my background was in like data analytics. Uh, so I would go and I would basically scrape all the platforms, but find best-selling products, do remixes of them, um, based off of like the keywords and how they looked aesthetically, etcetera. And so then this tool was a way to analyze basically like recurring purchases and understand like who my like best customers were and how could I then go and sell them more on like get them off platform onto an eCommerce channel. So, you know, getting him into Shopify, etcetera. Saw my own problem, wrote a blog post about it. Had a person message me on Facebook again, this was like 2015, 2016. We're like, hey, can you do this, but for me? And I was like, yeah, we'll have it live in seven days. So I called everybody and anybody that like could program because at the, at that point, I was pretty non-technical. I was, you know, very much a marketer and understood like, you know, I could write Python scripts, etcetera, but I couldn't build a, you know, a product. Um, hacked it together, got it out, got first-paying customer and was like, all right, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen. Like you just, you know, you're selling no physical products, it's just pixels that you're moving, and you get paid for that. And so, I mean, I was I was addicted, right? I was just joking, so.

[00:04:12] You take a unique approach in terms of how you look at small bets versus big bets and how you have this massive bias towards action to tinkering with a bunch of stuff, and then once something works, like double, triple down. You describe these levels, maybe if we start off with this first level of somebody who's watching this video, they're maybe working a full-time job, they just want to get something to replace their income. Let's just call it 10k MRR. What would, what opportunities do you see right now for, for someone?

[00:04:38] Quit your job, first off. Uh, second, the easiest ways to go about this right now are typically productized services that are powered by some type of AI tool. Um, so we'll break down what that means. Um, so what I would go do is try to learn some type of skill set that is not geographically constrained, so anything that you can do on the internet. I think that that's the first thing. Find some skill, double down. What I always advocate for is like everything that you learn, just literally make a YouTube video of that exact thing and put it on your channel and put it in public. Through that alone, you're gonna solve the cold start problem of how do I get distribution for this skill that I'm trying to sell. So once you've done that, uh, you're gonna naturally start getting inbound, you know, say during the Google Ads thing, right? You could do Google Ads for automotive shops, right? And then Fred is gonna come, and he's gonna be like, watch this video, and he's like, I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna spend the time thinking about this or managing this. Can I just go hire this person? Boom, you have your first customer. But say, you know, you charge three grand a month, you're trying to get to 10k MRR, you know, 10k of recurring revenue. All you need is three clients, right? Like if you make a video a day with like Google Ads for automotive, Google Ads, whatever that is, and you do that for 90 days straight. Like I guarantee you you can get, you know, three people to pay you three grand a month. There's another path that you can go down if you are more of like a you have programming experience, and I like the Chrome extensions one, it's like a classic just easy win. Anything that is data extraction, that is like a perfect Chrome extension. There's this one, it's called Email Extractor, I'm obsessed with it. I have been for like 10 years because it's just amazing to me. And like, it has 300,000 monthly active users. And that thing probably, I mean, I'm just throwing out numbers, can easily probably make two million a year, right?

[00:06:18] So say you're someone who's interested in making a Chrome extension, how would you like look at search data? How would you approach that?

[00:06:25] You could either go and use a tool like Semrush or Ahrefs, uh, find all of the long-tail keywords that are related to like Chrome extension scraper or Chrome extension extractor. The scraper or extractor words that has a high search intent for this is like, I'm trying to get this outcome to occur. You've already done market validation. And I think this is the thing that a lot of people mess up with uh when they initially start their first company. They try to invent something new. And it's actually the worst thing that you can do. The best thing that you can do is pick a play that's already been run before, and then you just execute on that. And you're gonna get way more experience, is gonna be a way faster successful. You're just gonna get to success way quicker. And then the pushback I always get immediately when I say that is, well, there's already people doing this. Like there's no way. And I'm like, yo, there's a hundred window washing companies in my city, and they're all making money at different levels. But they're all successful. So why are we thinking about internet businesses in a different way than that? That's they should be approached in the same kind of mindset, in my opinion.

[00:07:24] Right. Right. For whatever reason, when someone says internet, they're like, oh, I should have thought of that first. I'm late. But like any physical product.

[00:07:31] Feel like they've been brainwashed, you know? Like it's like you, you they've been brainwashed that it's a winner-take-all, and in reality, that's not the case. Like think how, how many email sending companies there are. Like Mailchimp, Klaviyo, I mean Beehive is moving into that market and taking over more market share. They're all having different levels of success. It just depends on the wedge that you get into that space.

[00:07:53] You're very well versed in all like, okay, this is specifically how I would do this. And I would use this tool. Can you just like walk through how you would maybe scrape Google Maps and like, what would you do?

[00:08:02] Yeah. First thing I would do, um, so I would go and I would find say we're just using the auto body shop again. You can go to Fiverr, you can pay a guy in Pakistan like 20 bucks, he's gonna go scrape 100,000 listings for you, right? Uh, tell him, hey, I want everybody with auto body shop in their title. That's one way. Another way is Outscraper, I actually bought the lifetime deal from uh AppSumo, which uh was it was awesome, I'm stoked about it. But basically what they do is uh you can go and it's basically a scraping tool that allows you to give like a target keyword and a geography, it goes finds everybody. Um, all you're trying to do is just get the URLs. Once you have the URLs, then you can do two things. Uh, you can use a tool called Hunter.io, which will allow for you to go and find uh the emails anywhere that, you know, they're basically referenced on other websites uh for that website. It's gonna help you identify those. Um, and then the other thing that you can use is called Phantom Buster. Phantom Buster, there's a um a phantom within it, which is basically just an automation that will go and uh go to every one of those websites, scrape the entire website and extract any of the emails out of it because a lot of these local businesses, like they're still using a Gmail, but they're doing 2.5 million a year, right? Like that's how they're running this company. And so, by doing both of those things, you take those emails, you then go and use a tool like Zerobounce or like Million Verifier. Those will uh validate those emails. Um, so what that means is uh basically you're trying to prove that this email is real, number one, is still active. Also, uh when you're doing cold email, if you get bounces or you you go into like what's called a catch-all, um, which is basically like a honey pot to say that that domain is sending spam. Um, you're you're circumventing that by just doing those verified emails. And then use a tool like Instantly AI or SmartLead, and uh that's how you can do that sending. Um, I would just go buy like, I mean, this infrastructure, we're sending at a way larger volume, right? But like the infrastructure I'm doing right now is 30 domains. You could buy those through Porkbun. Just get a variation of whatever your company's uh domain is. So imagine um, you know, uh Swell AI software, Swell AI tool.com, etcetera. Buy those 30 domains, you build five inboxes per domain. So in total, you'll have 150 inboxes that you can send from.

[00:10:12] And and you used to have to do that all separately in a different tool. You could do these now in these.

[00:10:17] Yeah, totally. Yeah. Instantly, I think has one built in. Um, I'm using this tool right now. It's called MailReef. Um, I I just got early beta access, so that's that's why I'm I'm there. Um, but basically uh they set up an AWS server um that uh is specialized for this. You can send 50,000 cold emails with MailReef for like around 400 bucks a month. Get a SmartLead account, uh you can hit 25,000 people in a month. I I guarantee you if you go and cold email 25,000 people that you do Google Ads as an offering uh for, you know, auto body shops, a certain percentage is gonna respond back. And because you already have like data to show because you have these three clients or whatever, like because you got that inbound from YouTube or whatever that ends up being. That's that way that you can grow this agency. That's how you can build that out. That's like specific. And I think that these are actually some of the best like types of companies uh or agencies to run is when they focus on a specific niche because as soon as you identify an arbitrage for one client, you can apply that to everybody. And so it creates a stickiness within uh your your, you know, client ecosystem. The company I always go back to, it's called Suds Creative. It's just like a no-name company. If you look on like Usha or whatever the the um the sites are that you can like look up the revenues uh like of what people estimate. It says that it gets like six to seven million is what it does. I know it's like double that because we I have a friend that worked there. And uh they all they do is just basically digital marketing for uh for car washes. That's their entire game plan, and it's probably doing 15 million a year at an 80% margin with like 50 employees. Like half of them are offshored. I mean, this is the this is the game you can play now, and uh I I think anybody can go and do this because the really the pandemic like changed all how people are willing to be sold. Like I'm way more willing to buy if you've got a good mic, a good camera, and good lighting. Like I trust you now because like I've kind of been trained over the last four years that uh this is how like we basically purchase things. So.

[00:12:15] Can you maybe talk about how you look at building businesses in general of like starting with these, having them cash flow, and then building other businesses? One of the themes is you just don't know what those clients' like problems are going to be. And so getting really close to an auto shop or a car wash shop, maybe that uncovers the idea for a SaaS versus just like, oh, maybe I'll randomly come up with a SaaS idea.

[00:12:37] I was doing, I was working at this company called Rupa Health. I was like employee six there. Uh, we ended up taking it from like 10 million, it was a 20 million dollar valuation to 110 in about six months. It was insane. It's a marketplace for like lab test ordering. We realized that like content was gonna be this way that we were gonna have to sell to this audience. So we spun up a podcast, we spun up a live class series, all this other stuff. But um the whole purpose of that was like, hey, we could build this long-form piece of content and then chop it up into all these small bite-sized pieces that we could distribute across all the platforms. And like it's a perfect example of like, oh, when I solved problems for like these, whatever it is. I always just go back to like biology. Like atrophy is actually how things die. If you just keep moving, you are 100% gonna figure something out. The only reason they die is because they stop existing. That first company we were talking about does like still like nine grand a month, right? If I stopped that month, too, because it was only doing like 300 a month, none of the benefit that has happened in the last whatever, you know, six years of existing would have ever happened. And so like these things can limp along, too. They don't have to be these like, I I don't know, I'm just I just have a different view on this of like how like all the bets also compound on each other. I I kind of think about like I have these small bets that I know are like easy wins, and then I have these like, you know, almost like black swan events uh that I'm like trying to bet on. Of like, cool, can I like make this huge platform or like this thing that's in a mass market with a huge TAM that I can approach. All these other things, like I'm I'm gonna live a good life no matter what. But if one of, if this thing hits, like one of these big bets hits, it's game up. Like, you know, and just made it so my kids have to, my kids have to go to therapy because, you know, they went to private school for too long and don't know how to interact with the real world, so.

[00:14:13] Uh, what are some of those bigger bets that that you're placing right now?

[00:14:17] Yeah, the the biggest, uh, what I'm really excited about is a new company we're building called landingcat.com. We basically uh build out collection landing pages for Shopify, they're called category pages for WordPress, based off of uh the company's product catalog. So, uh traditionally, like you'd have to go and do this all manually. Um, we built this tool set that allows for us to like index an entire product catalog. We then can take that crop, that whatever that product catalog is, we go and find all the long-tail keywords related to that product catalog. And then we can programmatically generate these landing pages, um these collection pages uh based off of the product catalog and then those keywords. We basically do that matching process.

[00:14:53] And how do you go about launching something like that?

[00:14:55] Yeah, so I did did it on Twitter. I called some friends that own eCommerce companies, um, and basically was just like, hey, we're doing this thing, I don't know if it's gonna work. Um, can we run some tests and see what happens? Uh, just got initial great data. And again, this is like comes back to like when you've done these other things and you have that history, you have all these doors open that you never would have previously, right? Like we took Landing Cat from non-existent to 100k ARR in like four weeks. And like the only way that you could do that is if you had like all of these relationships.

[00:15:29] Four weeks. In four weeks, yeah. Um, I just had a call this morning with like a huge, you know, conglomerate out of New York. They're a holding company for like all these like classic brands, and they're like, yo, this is a massive issue, right? Because like they they're just trying to get as much basically traffic as they can to the site because they know that that like directly translates into purchase revenue, it translates into emails that turn into uh, you know, email revenue pipelines through Klaviyo or, you know, whatever they're using as their toolset. That's what I'm I get most excited about is when you're talking to these companies that are like, yeah, this is a massive problem that we're facing, and you can solve it in a way that's like way less, it's painless basically in comparison to what they're doing currently. So.

[00:16:07] What about moving, playing, like progressing along to 20k, 50k. What are some of the business ideas you have for that tier?

[00:16:15] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I think there's a huge opportunity right now in like anything related to content repurposing um for founders or for companies. Two examples um that I think are just, you know, ripe for the taking are one is uh basically doing like unlimited webinar repurposing for any B2B company. So like if you look at the data, it's like 80% of B2B companies do webinars. It's just nuts, right? Like it's like almost all of them. So if you just cold email like every mark, every person like that has a marketing job title, right? And you're like, hey, we do unlimited webinar repurposing. We'll turn it into eBooks, we'll turn it into white papers, we'll turn it into blog posts. Like you're gonna get people that want this because a lot of them have this like back catalog of, you know, whatever 500 webinars they ran over the last five years, and they're it's just sitting there, you know? It's just rotting. And so if you can resurrect that, I think these companies. Also, just the price point, like yeah, you can come in easily and be like, yeah, it's five K a month. We'll do as much as you want, right? And like all you're doing is building AI like workflows to do this. Yeah, so uh the other one is newsletters for founders. Um, and so newsletters for founders, like all of them are trying to create a personal brand. They have no idea where to start for this. And uh if you just go to them and you're like, hey, I'm gonna interview you 30 minutes out of your week. If we take that transcript, we're gonna turn it into a written newsletter, then we'll also like grow that newsletter for you and distribute it out to your whatever your target audience is. They're gonna say yes in a heartbeat. There's this ego that's built into that, right? It's like if when you have a bigger follower following uh across all these channels like I all these things. And it is actually valuable. I think that's the thing that people don't realize. Like if I cold DM from an account with 500 followers on Twitter, the response rate is gonna be lower than if I cold DM from an account with 30,000 like followers on Twitter. There's a million different ways. Honestly, just go YouTube how to grow email newsletter lists and you you can find.

[00:18:04] You've started a bunch of these businesses, some of them are really working, others are cash flowing nicely. How much do you think like you're just smarter than other people versus you just don't stop trying stuff?

[00:18:15] I I think I'm I'm I'm definitely a big numbers person. It's funny, I've worked for people where they're like, no, everything has to be perfect, and they have and they're great at it, right? That you know, they're very refined. And I I'm definitely not that. I'm more like, I'm gonna try a hundred things. We're gonna see that three percent of that worked. And we're gonna, I'm gonna put all of our resources, like, you know, limited resources into those things, so.

[00:18:40] Right. So, way more on the side of just like letting the market dictate and trying a bunch of things, knowing that most of them are gonna fail.

[00:18:46] I can't convince like Coca-Cola is one of the biggest companies in the world, and they can't convince people to drink more soda with all the money in the world. And we think that like in our just an form of us that we're gonna be able to change no. The the the only thing that is going to be possible for us to do is ride a larger wave than us. So our job as founders, especially if you're bootstrapping or you're self-funding, your job is to scope waves and be like, cool. That one, that looks good. How do I get there? And as you get more time in the water, you start to understand, oh, these types of waves are gonna be a better ride. Okay. So, but the only way to get that is by spending time in the water.

[00:19:26] You spend a lot of time in the water. What other waves do you see?

[00:19:28] I think the the other thing that I'm realizing is becoming just like, man, I I don't even know if you need funding in the same way that you used to. I'm personally obsessed with like can a company market itself, right? We have some tests that we're running of just like, you know, random stuff of like, cool, like this AI is deciding on the products we build and like, you know, on the eCommerce side. And like it's just print-on-demand, right? It's like it's low risk, but it's like, you know, can it do that? Can it like run a company? And like this is this is a more philosophical thing and that I find interesting. Like all the data exists and all of the like decision-making exists for like a decent okay company to just run itself. And so that's kind of what I'm obsessing on. That's like the larger thing, the scaled-down version of that uh from like the bigger trends that are happening. I think that what you're going to see is way more like multi-preneurship. Um, I think that that is just going to become a standard, especially with the ability to get global talent as you can now. Um, you can just you know, run these companies, start these companies at a at a scale and at a pace and at a volume that you I mean, over the weekend, I built a Chrome extension that we're gonna launch, right? Like it was me, you know, messing around for an hour and a half over coffee. And like I already knew that there's keyword volume for it. I'm gonna like buy a domain and spin it up and within like two weeks, we're gonna have like our initial people using it and like that whole thing was just like AI generated code. I'm gonna know within a month whether we can turn this into a company or not.

[00:20:56] Yeah, or just like specific big wave. It sounds like you make these calculated bets, but the reason that you did a Chrome extension in the weekend is because you saw the search volume before. And so like, like step one, have search volume, or step one, have somebody paying you for it to solve a problem. All the small bets are there like I'm just, it's transactional, right? People are looking for this, can I build that? All the big bets, like what we're saying with that is, okay, people are doing it this way, it's very resource-intensive. Like, can I cut that resource intensity down by like, you know, to 10% of what it was previously. Or or down to 1% and then I charge them 10% of like whatever they're paying for. Like for example, if somebody's, you know, if say they're investing 300,000 a year into whatever activity that they're doing, maybe it's salaries, maybe it's software, all these other things. If I can go to them and be like, yo, I'm gonna charge you 30 grand and we're gonna be 10X better, like they're gonna say yes every time. And then your job is just how do I get in front of them? How do I figure out how to get in front of them? So.

[00:21:56] Right. So constantly testing different offers and then figuring out ways that you can fulfill that.

[00:22:01] For sure. Yeah. First off, you're an idea machine. So, we'll let's just rattle off a few more of these. I think it's really helpful just the heuristic of I think you've said just find wealthy people or find business owners. Like how could you walk through a few examples of where you could maybe find those people?

[00:22:17] You can find literally the zip codes of the wealthiest people in like every area in the United States, right? So like, number one, you already know where they live. So if you're like trying to start like even a service business, like say you're like power washing or something, like go to those neighborhoods. If you can get into them, right? And like sell those types of people. Really fascinating the data, like whatever economic level that you're in, you only interact with that economic level. It's like very rare that you engage outside of that because you're uninteresting at all those other levels. Like you're uninteresting to the higher level, you're uninteresting to the lower level, like you just like have different problems and in different kinds of aspects. But I would go and look for the companies that like rich people go to, right? Like estheticians or like CrossFit gyms or, you know, any of these things that are like service businesses that like have a high ticket price on a monthly basis that are there as a barrier to entry, right? And all, you know, they're servicing those types of people. They typically have money that they can spend, and it's it's one of the best ways that you can go and about creating a company is servicing those types of businesses. So like go to a CrossFit gym and be like, yo, like we handle all of your digital, right? Like we do lead gen, you know? We're gonna run Google Ads, we'll do Facebook Ads, we'll grow your Instagram account, we'll handle all of your scheduling, and then we'll also do like, you know, eBook downloads and do an email nurture and send out an email on a weekly basis, talking to you, the founder of the CrossFit gym, about like whatever it is that you're thinking about or what's working in in your space. And I mean ran a small little agency doing this exact same thing, right? Like literally just for CrossFit gyms. Same playbooks. Like we're using the exact same like strategies and tactics just applied in these different locations. And all of that information, like I I literally just YouTubed how to do all that. And like there's great channels out there. Like if you're trying to figure out how to run like PPC ads or Google Ads for any type of service business. There's this it's called like uh Surfside PPC. Just this dude who's been doing it for like 15 years and like I don't even know. I think he has like 200,000 subs or something like that, but every variation of what you're trying to target, he's probably done it at some point. And then from a data analytics standpoint, like also other great channels that all this can be learned from. Like one's called Loves Data, another one's called uh Analytics Mania, um, and basically they just like teach you how to actually do reporting and then like share that information back to your client.

[00:29:30] I think that's the thing that most people mess up on when they're initially starting these agencies is like how do I create a North Star metric and get buy-in from the clients that we're both on the same page of this is our measurement of success, everything else is superfluous. And then just constantly, you know, basically report on that information. Earlier we were talking about like just different potential clients or opportunities. And we're talking about farmers a little bit. What um do you think there's an opportunity of having farmers be your client?

[00:24:55] Totally. Like anybody that has a ton of capital and the challenge with those types of industries is that it's like good old boy handshake style stuff, right? So it's a lot of who you know, you know? You have to be dancing with wolves, you become a part of that culture, right? So a lot of the times, it's very hard to break into. That's the only thing I would say and I've seen people make these mistakes in the past where it's like I've even done it as well. There was this moment where I was we built this like funeral home software, right? Just a vertical SaaS, we're gonna go sell it, and I was like, I'm, you know, this is gonna be a kick. Dude, way harder than I thought. Just hard to sell. It's just an industry I didn't understand deeply, and it was it'd probably be the last time that I ever do that unless I partner or like buy a portion of a company that has some type of deep domain knowledge. So if you have some domain knowledge in that, way different. But if you can't speak that language, the hurdles that you're gonna have to go through is just gonna be hard to cultivate trust and build that.

[00:25:46] One of my favorite sayings is start where you are, use what you have. So say for somebody who maybe has a relationship with a farmer or maybe has, you know, we talked about the CrossFit example, just for the context, like how would you approach adding value to a farmer if you hadn't that relationship?

[00:26:01] Service businesses are the best way to understand people's problems. So if you can come in

[00:27:40] 100%. I get asked this question constantly. Where should I market? Should it be Facebook? Should it be Google Ads? Should it be LinkedIn? Like, where is your customer? Like, that is the first question I ask any founder that I ever talked to. And if they answer I don't know, then it's like cool, like figure that out. Once you have that figured out, be in front of them every day, every week, every month indefinitely until the company dies. Like you wanna build a brand, that is the only way that I've ever seen people do it, is you have to show up where they are on a consistent basis. Like we saw for this trailer company, like all these farmers were out and they were out of self-service, right? So like it was just very hard to get in front of them. So we started doing research for the client, realized that oh this gas station is where they hung out. Let's just like can we make like just like a, you know, a little simple magazine that we can just put like at this place and like see if they can take it. And then the angle that we ended up finding that works was, oh, what if we go interview the people that are showing up there, right? So if you profile an individual and they're like, oh, I know Cheryl, like Cheryl's awesome, right? And then the whole community gets excited about. Magazine was just like little stories about the industry like in that local area. But then they saw that oh gyms are in this, like why am I not in this? But it creates that conversation. And then you have ads within that, right? It was just like a super simple playbook. And you gotta be agnostic to the platform, to the channel. It's just wherever they are. Again, just meet them where they are. It's super simple.

[00:29:00] What are some of like the either software tools or some of these other examples that people don't necessarily realize even if they're, you know, have an online business? Yeah, yeah. I think I've heard you talk about Supermetrics or like what what are some of your favorite tools that most people don't know? Oh, I live by Supermetrics. I have this grandfather account, please for the love of god don't take it away from me. Supermetrics is a data pipeline tool. It basically allows you to uh transfer data from like all these different sources into a single dashboard so that you can do like business intelligence analytics. So to make that more concrete, I can take Facebook data, Google Ads data, my search console data, my LinkedIn Ads data. If you're doing like email marketing or using Lob to send direct mail, you can pipe all of that into a single dashboard. Now called Looker Studio, it used to be called Google Data Studio. It's a free tool that anybody can plug into. And what that then allows you to do is you can see all of this data in a single place that's coming from all these different channels, which traditionally siloed, right? Like they it comes hard to do reporting. And there's a bunch of other tools that do this. I just seem use this because that's what I know. You're trying to just understand like what is the heartbeat of your company and these allows you to do that. The pipes are so important. Also, if you can translate that, if you can take that data and tell a story with it to somebody. You have just become god tier in whatever industry, whatever business you're in, because that is so hard. How does the data tell that story? And if you can figure out how to learn that, and all this is learn, right? Like you can all those YouTube channels I just talked about, all they're doing is just like we have raw data, and we're turning it into information. And then we're gonna tell a story about what that information means. If you can do that, you are gonna become the most valuable person within your company. You're also gonna become incredibly valuable to other companies, and you're probably gonna just evolve into a founder because it's just naturally where this goes.

[00:30:43] You mentioned a lot of these tools, like it's almost as if these tools give you superpowers. You mentioned Supermetrics, what are some of the other ones that are like core part of your stack of how you find keywords, how you find demand, and how you do other things? Yeah, yeah. So Keywords Everywhere is a great tool for anybody that's just like entry-level SEO. Um, it's a Chrome extension. I would love to clone it. Just because I use it so much. But uh, it's super approachable on the price point. I think you can pay like 18 bucks and get 100,000 credits for a normal person that'll last you probably 10 months. For me, it's like 30 days, but and then another cool SEMrush or Semrush. I use them largely for they have this specific feature called Keyword Magic. Basically, it finds all the long-tail keywords within whatever you provide it. So if say you're doing something, you know, like dresses, right? It'll go find like every variation, like black cocktail dress, emerald green, you know. So that's, you know, daily part of my stack. Just like everybody using Figma constantly, using uh Webflow constantly. All of these AI tools are just like a a beginning point to get at 80% of the way there. And then how do I like come over the top of that and improve that piece of it? You know, whatever it initially provides. There isn't a good graphic designer yet. The only one I've seen that I'm like pretty excited about is called Playground.com. Basically, you can like give it Tiger SVG and it goes and like generates that, right? But it's like pixel perfect. It's pretty on point. Those are the kind of the tools that I'm using constantly, and like starting to experiment with more. But Yeah.

[00:32:04] So you have your hands on a lot of things right now. Is there anything if you're like, man, if I just had more hours in the day like that you you'd be itching to do? I'm obsessed with this unstructured data to structured data thing. All this information is locked up in like video and in audio that that never used to be really accessible because it was just very expensive to pull out. Really the transcripts is really what it came down to. An example is horse betting. So my brother is like a degenerate gambler. G, I love him. Basically to find uh like arbitrage within that, you have to understand all the kind of information of course and the horse and all this other stuff that's going on. All that's just locked up in like streams that have happened previously. But if you can go and unlock that like you suddenly have an angle and like you can play that margin game. When you look at all of these companies that are providing like business intelligence data, there's really a lot of what they're doing. They're just like aggregating all these sources, organizing it, and then they sell you some report for like 300 grand. AI is unbelievable taking unstructured things and then structuring those. And so this is like again a larger idea, not so much of a concrete one, but if you can find any of those types of industries that were like all this almost like a mess of information, and then how do I organize that? How do I turn that into structured data that I can use and then analyze? That's where the billion-dollar companies are in my opinion over the next 10 years.

[00:33:22] Right. And then maybe just quick rapid fire a few low-hanging fruits. I think you've you've talked about QuickBooks apps. Like any other like things like that where there's just like high probability of success. I think that any large product that has an App Store like massive opportunity still to this day. WordPress plugins are still a massive one, right? Like just the other day I saw like uh the search volume or like WordPress banner and there's like exact match domains that you could go buy. And an exact match domain what that means is like there's a keyword that somebody's searching, like a keyword phrase. And you can go find that exact domain to purchase, like the .com. And then if you throw like 10 backlinks at it, you can get those things to rank for whatever that target keyword phrase is. It'd be hard to get a single site to rank for it for like the cost, but then I can point those all back to a single like tool product. And like just a tactical way to like, you know, kind of get that initial inbound. You pixel everybody across all those so they enter with Google search, you get that free first traffic. Pixel them on Facebook and on Google, and then you remarket to them like constantly about whatever that product is. The QuickBooks apps one is just a classic. It's like people just want integrations, right? Like email marketing is probably another huge one. Like looking at like Omnisend or like any of these these types of companies. People are just trying to like pipe data from Supermetrics is this is all they're doing, right? It's moving data from here to there. I think that these are some of the best companies to own just because it's like a very specific thing that it's trying to solve. And when you don't have that anymore, it suddenly becomes very apparent to the company very quickly, right? Probably a big one actually is the Zoom App Store. Again, obsessed with these types of spaces where it's like huge user bases, no applications. Like, you could just go look like Zoom apps for XYZ.

[00:35:07] Okay, last thing, do you have any contrarian views or high convictions of of things that you believe? I think that distribution is more important than products. And if you tell anybody that, especially if they come from the Valley or traditional companies, they're like, no, product is king and rules. Dude, worst product wins all the time, like constantly. Like NetSuite is the perfect example. Massive company, makes tons of money. Terrible product, unbelievably terrible to use. And for people that don't know, it's like basically just like it's almost like a CRM or email sender. I I don't even know. I don't even know what category you'd put in. I think that so often you have great products that never get into orbit because they just have terrible distribution. But companies that have good distribution but okay product, they can survive, they can live. And so I think that it's more important, it's more valuable. Cody Schneider, the master of distribution, where can people check you out? Any final message that you wanna give to viewers who have loves these ideas and wants to apply them for their own business?

[00:36:04] Yeah, yeah, yeah. So active on uh Twitter and LinkedIn, those are probably the two places uh from the social side and uh my YouTube as well. If you Google my name, I should come up. If I don't, I'm really bad at my job. The final thing that I'll say is like just start the thing literally today, like right now. Like whatever that thing is. And it can be small. Like it's like literally just like go learn something on YouTube and then whatever you just learned, teach it and record that like in a Loom video. That's a business. And if you do that for 180 days, like you will get enough subscribers, you will get enough views that you will make revenue off of that YouTube channel, and you make your first dollar online. And that's just a gateway drug. Like that is actually the gateway drug to all of this. It's like that first time that you get paid from some random stranger or random thing on the internet. Like it's you're done. It's game over. So. Start the thing right now. Awesome. Thanks for having me, dude. Thanks for having me. Yeah, check them out.
