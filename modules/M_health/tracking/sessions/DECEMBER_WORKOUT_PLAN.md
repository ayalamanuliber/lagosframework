- **Pre-Workout**: 15 min walk serves as initial warm-up
- **Post-Workout**: 15 min walk aids recovery
- **Weekly Total**: ~8.4km from gym commute alone

This walking is perfect because:
1. Elevates heart rate gradually before training
2. Improves blood flow for better warm-up
3. Helps cool down after session
4. Contributes to daily step goal

Note: No need for additional warm-up cardio, can start with movement-specific warm-ups listed in workout plan.

## Ab Work (Optional During Rest Periods)
- Hanging Leg Raises: 3 × 12
- Cable Crunches: 3 × 15

## Progressive Overload Strategy 📈
1. **December Focus**
   - Weeks 1-2: Build work capacity (10-12 reps)
   - Weeks 3-4: Increase intensity (8-10 reps)
   - Week 5: Deload (reduce weight by 20%)

2. **Volume Guidelines**
   - Large muscles: 10-12 sets/week
   - Small muscles: 8-10 sets/week
   - Increase by 1-2 sets/week if recovering well

## Recovery Protocol 🔄
### Active Recovery Days
- Light walking: 20-30 mins
- Upper body mobility work: 10-15 mins
- Stretching: Focus on shoulders and back

### Rest Days
- Sleep: 8 hours (as per your goals)
