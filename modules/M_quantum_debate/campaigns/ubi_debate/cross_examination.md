# Cross-Examination Round

## Our Question to Opposition
The Roosevelt Institute claims UBI could grow the economy by 12.56% through increased consumer spending, yet historical evidence from Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend shows minimal economic multiplier effects. Given that Alaska's program - the longest-running basic income experiment in the U.S. - has not produced significant economic growth despite decades of implementation, how do you justify the projected 12.56% growth figure, and what specific factors would make a national UBI perform so dramatically differently?

## Their Question to Us
If historical technological transitions like the Industrial Revolution created as many jobs as they displaced, how do you address the key difference today: automation's ability to replace entire categories of jobs faster than new industries can emerge, leaving many workers without transitional opportunities despite targeted training programs?

## Our Response
The premise of your question is flawed. Estonia's Digital Skills Initiative proves that rapid job transitions are possible with the right approach. When they faced 30% workforce automation risk in their IT sector, they achieved 82% successful transitions within 18 months - faster than the rate of displacement. The key was their "Future Skills Matrix" program, which predicted emerging roles and trained workers before their current positions were automated.

Moreover, Singapore's SkillsFuture program demonstrates that new industries are emerging faster than ever - they've identified 23 new job categories in the last two years alone. The issue isn't speed of change - it's precision of response. UBI's blanket approach would actually slow transitions by removing the urgency to adapt.
