### LinkedIn Post 1: Reality Check
#### Content
A managing partner asked me yesterday: "Cut the hype. What's AI actually doing in law firms?"

Fair question. Here's what I've seen after 3 years in the trenches:

‚úì We're processing contracts in 47 minutes instead of 6 hours.
‚úì We caught three deal-breaking clauses humans missed last month.
‚úì Our document drafts are faster. Not perfect, but faster.

êÑÇ But AI completely failed us in negotiations.
êÑÇ Couldn't read between the lines in depositions.
êÑÇ Made rookie mistakes on complex judgments.

Learned this the hard way: AI isn't replacing lawyers. Not even close.

It's just a tool. Like a really fast paralegal who works at 3am.

Want to try it? Start with document review. Easy to measure. Hard to mess up.

Been testing AI in your firm? Tell me what broke.

### LinkedIn Post 2: Document Analysis Deep-Dive
#### Content
Just finished a brutal month testing doc review tools.

Know what's crazy? The fastest one did 50 pages in 2.3 minutes.

But here's the thing nobody talks about:
êÑÇ 7 tools completely missed context.
êÑÇ 4 made up clauses that didn't exist.
êÑÇ 3 just died on big PDFs.

Tested everything from $50 to $2000 monthly tools.
Plot twist: the expensive ones weren't always better.

What actually worked:
‚úì Grab a basic tool ($200/mo)
‚úì Let it do the first pass
‚úì Human checks the tricky parts
‚úì AI does one final sweep

Sounds simple? It is. That's the point.

Most vendors won't tell you this, but you don't need their $2000 package.
You need a $200 tool and good process.
