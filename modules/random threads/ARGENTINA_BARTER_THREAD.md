üßµ How Argentina created a parallel economy of 2.5 million people when the government froze all bank accounts

A thread about how el mercado se impone, featuring dentists accepting eggs as payment...

1/ December 2001: Argentina's government freezes all bank accounts (el corralito).

The goal? Stop bank runs and save the economy.

What actually happened? The most creative economic system since the invention of money üè¶

2/ The numbers were INSANE:
‚Ä¢ Bank accounts: Frozen
‚Ä¢ Cash available: Almost zero
‚Ä¢ Official economy: Collapsed
‚Ä¢ Government solution: "Sorry, deal with it"

Spoiler: The market dealt with it... just not how anyone expected üìâ

3/ Enter "Los Clubes del Trueque" (Barter Clubs):
‚Ä¢ Started in garages
‚Ä¢ Spread like wildfire
‚Ä¢ Created their own currency
‚Ä¢ Became bigger than some banks
‚Ä¢ Had better credit systems than the government

4/ The system got SOPHISTICATED:
‚Ä¢ Neighborhood "cr√©ditos" (local currencies)
‚Ä¢ Weekly markets in every barrio
‚Ä¢ Professional services for food
‚Ä¢ Lawyers accepting chickens
‚Ä¢ Dentists trading root canals for eggs

This wasn't stone age barter. This was Barter 2.0 ü•ö

5/ The SCALE is mind-blowing:
‚Ä¢ 2.5 million people involved
‚Ä¢ 4,500 official barter locations
‚Ä¢ 400+ types of local currencies
‚Ä¢ Thousands of professionals
‚Ä¢ Entire supply chains running on cr√©ditos

La econom√≠a se impone üéØ

6/ Some WILD transactions:
‚Ä¢ Root canal = 30 chickens
‚Ä¢ Legal advice = 100kg of vegetables
‚Ä¢ English classes = Home-cooked meals
‚Ä¢ Haircuts = Homemade bread
‚Ä¢ Therapy sessions = Handmade clothes

7/ The system got so legit:
‚Ä¢ Had its own economists
‚Ä¢ Created exchange rates
‚Ä¢ Developed quality controls
‚Ä¢ Built trust networks
‚Ä¢ Even handled B2B transactions

All while the official economy was "frozen" üßä

8/ The government's reaction?
First: "This is illegal!"
Then: "This is concerning..."
Finally: "How do we tax this?" 

Spoiler: You can't tax eggs and chickens easily üêî

9/ The best part? People innovated HARD:
‚Ä¢ Architects accepting partial payment in vegetables
‚Ä¢ Doctors creating "health care plans" in bread
‚Ä¢ Teachers taking payment in home services
‚Ä¢ Engineers trading skills for food

A whole professional class went full barter mode üí°

10/ By 2002:
‚Ä¢ Barter markets > Regular markets
‚Ä¢ Local cr√©ditos > Official peso (in some areas)
‚Ä¢ Community trust > Bank guarantees
‚Ä¢ Informal networks > Official economy

11/ The lasting impact?
‚Ä¢ Neighborhoods became self-sufficient
‚Ä¢ People learned real value of skills
‚Ä¢ Communities grew stronger
‚Ä¢ Everyone became an economist
‚Ä¢ Argentina discovered its resilience

12/ As one club organizer said:

"They froze our money, so we created our own. They broke the economy, so we built another one. They said it couldn't work, so we made it work better."

13/ The ultimate proof that el mercado se impone:
‚Ä¢ Government: "Don't move money!"
‚Ä¢ People: "Cool, we'll make our own"
‚Ä¢ Government: "That's not real money!"
‚Ä¢ People: "Works better than yours though"

14/ Remember folks:

You can freeze bank accounts
But you can't freeze human creativity

El mercado se impone... one chicken-for-service trade at a time üêî
