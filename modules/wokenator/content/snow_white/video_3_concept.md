# Video 3 Concept: Hollywood's New Formula

## Overview
- **Title**: "Hollywood's New Formula (And Why Every Remake is the Same)"
- **Series**: Snow White Woke Chronicles
- **Duration**: 8-12 minutes
- **Type**: Analysis/Comedy

## Core Elements
### Hook
- Pedro casually mixing a drink while the Woke Detector starts beeping randomly
- "You know what's funny? Every remake lately follows the exact same recipe. It's like they're all cooking in the same kitchen... with expired ingredients."
- Detector goes crazy when he mentions "kitchen" - he looks at it confused: "What? No, that's not a sexist... ay, shut up!"

### Key Points
1. The Universal Recipe
   - Every remake starts with "modernizing" the female lead
   - Villains get tragic backstories nobody asked for
   - Male characters get "nerfed" or turned into comic relief
   - Forced contemporary messages that break immersion

2. The Industry Logic
   - Focus groups and market research misinterpretation
   - International market considerations
   - Fear of Twitter backlash
   - The "checklist" mentality

3. The Woke Bingo Card Segment
   - Pulls out a bingo card mid-analysis
   - Gets increasingly excited checking boxes
   - "Wait wait wait... evil stepmother with trauma? BINGO! *Spanish guitar riff* ¡Lo sabía!"
   - Card fills up way too fast - "This isn't even fun anymore..."

4. The Real Problem
   - Not about representation, but lazy writing
   - Loss of what made originals timeless
   - Treating audiences like they're stupid

### Character Moments
- Gets increasingly frustrated with examples, slipping into Spanish
- Mom calls mid-rant about "modern princesses" - he instantly softens
- Tries to demonstrate a point with action figures, gets embarrassed
- Woke Detector keeps interrupting at wrong moments

### Woke Detector Usage
- Progressive beeping throughout examples
- Malfunctions during the "kitchen" comment
- Goes crazy during Snow White clips
- Final reading: "Critical Mass of Modern Storytelling Enhancement Detected"
