# Core Arguments

## 1. Statistical Misrepresentation
- Wage gap statistics often ignore:
  * Career choices
  * Hours worked
  * Position level
  * Risk factors
- Impact: Misdirected solutions that don't address root causes

## 2. Equality vs Equity
- Current focus on outcome equality rather than opportunity equality
- Undermines meritocracy principles
- Creates new forms of discrimination

## 3. Counterproductive Messaging
- Alienating potential allies
- Creating unnecessary division
- Focusing on trivial issues over substantive ones

## 4. Policy Implications
- Quota systems over qualification-based selection
- Discriminatory positive action policies
- Reduced workplace efficiency

## 5. Alternative Approaches
- Focus on specific, measurable inequalities
- Promote merit-based advancement
- Address systemic barriers without discrimination
- Encourage collaborative solutions
