## How to Use

1. **Adding New Knowledge**
   - Drop raw notes in appropriate `/raw_knowledge` subfolder
   - Tag with #toprocess if needs review

2. **Processing Knowledge**
   - Review #toprocess items during quantum sessions
   - Move resonating concepts to `/quantum_resonance`
   - Add implementation notes

3. **Implementation**
   - Test concepts in `/quantum_resonance/experiments`
   - Move proven wins to `/manu_core`
   - Log evolution in `/manu_core/evolution_log`

## Navigation
- Use `#tags` for cross-referencing
- Each folder has its own `_INDEX.md`
- Link related concepts across folders
