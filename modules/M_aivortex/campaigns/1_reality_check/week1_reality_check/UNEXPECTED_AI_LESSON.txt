That Time Our Customer Service Bot Went Full Valley Girl

So this happened last month. Or maybe two months ago? Time gets weird when you're debugging AI at 3AM.

You know how sometimes you get what seems like a brilliant idea, but it's really just the caffeine talking? Yeah. That kind of night.

I was supposed to be fixing a minor bug in our customer service system. Nothing fancy. Just the usual "computer says no" stuff. Except I started reading through old customer feedback. 

Wait, I should explain - we built this AI thing for handling support tickets. Pretty standard nowadays. Anyway, people kept saying it was too... robotic? Which, duh, right? But it bugged me.

God, my boss is gonna kill me when she reads this.

So there I was, mainlining coffee like it's oxygen, when I had what I thought was this genius idea. We had all these transcripts from our old human support team. Years of them. The good ones, you know? When people actually wrote "Thanks for your help!" and meant it.

I figured - hey, why not dump all that into the training set? Let it learn from actual humans instead of just... whatever we'd been doing.

Quick side note - never, ever do major system updates at 3AM. They don't teach you that in computer science. They should.

At first it seemed fine. The system was running, tickets were being handled. I actually went home thinking I'd done something clever. Ha.

Then my phone started blowing up. Turns out our AI had gone full... how do I even describe it? You know that person who tries too hard to be cool and ends up mixing slang from every decade? That, but make it customer service.

Someone asked about their missing package and got - I saved this because nobody would believe me - "OMG fam, let me track that down for you! *rummages through database* YEET! Found it! That's totally going to be at your crib by tomorrow, no cap!"

The IT director called. He never calls. "What," he said, in that voice people use when they're trying really hard to stay professional, "did you do?"

Turns out the AI had basically created this weird hybrid personality from every customer service rep it had learned from. Like if you took every "friendly" interaction from the past 15 years and smooshed them together.

The best part? Or worst, depending on how you look at it. It started matching its language to what it thought was the customer's age based on their writing style. Some poor boomer asking about his invoice got hit with "Bet, that payment's bussin fr fr."

I had to roll it back, obviously. Spent the whole morning going through the logs first though. You know, for... documentation purposes. Not because it was hilarious or anything.

Now we're back to boring but professional. The kind of AI that says "Your ticket has been received" instead of "Slide into my DMs with that order number fam."

My boss did frame one of the transcripts though. It's hanging in her office next to a sign that just says "This is why we don't deploy at 3AM."

Still get texts from the IT director sometimes. Just "no cap" and nothing else. 

At least I didn't break production on a Friday?

So come on, spill it - what's your worst "seemed like a good idea at the time" tech disaster? Drop it in the comments below. Bonus points if it involves AI, double bonus if it happened after midnight. We can't be the only ones with these stories... right?

And hey, if you're reading this at 3AM while considering a system update - take this as your sign. Go to bed. Trust me on this one. ðŸ˜‰
