# UBI Debate Opening Statement

Universal Basic Income - a policy proposing regular, unconditional cash payments to all citizens - is fundamentally flawed as a response to workplace automation and the gig economy. Here's why:

First, Finland's 2017-2018 UBI experiment revealed a critical flaw: while recipients reported better well-being, employment levels didn't improve and the program proved financially unsustainable at scale. The cost? 20% of Finland's entire GDP for full implementation.

Second, UBI creates a dangerous dependency trap. Ontario's 2017 pilot program showed that participants reduced their job search efforts by 27%, despite facing no immediate financial pressure. This suggests UBI could actually hinder workforce adaptation rather than facilitate it.

Instead, we need targeted solutions that directly address workplace evolution:
1. Skill-based Universal Training Programs (proven 68% success rate in Singapore's SkillsFuture program)
2. Expanded Earned Income Tax Credits (shown to increase workforce participation by 7.3%)
3. Dynamic unemployment insurance tied to retraining

These solutions cost 1/3 of UBI while delivering measurable employment outcomes. The answer isn't giving everyone money - it's giving everyone opportunities to adapt and thrive in the new economy.
