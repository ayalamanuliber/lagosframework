# WOKE COLLAPSE: ULTIMATE SPEECH

## Opening Strike (30 seconds)
```
TRUTH BOMB
They built a system of control.
Called it progress.
Called it justice.
Called it inclusion.
But reality?
Reality had other plans.
```

## Market Reality (60 seconds)
```
NUMBERS HIT
Disney lost One Billion Dollars.
Pushing ideology over story.
Bud Light lost their crown.
Forcing message over market.
Target faced truth.
Choosing agenda over value.

That's not progress.
That's market justice.
```

## System Break (60 seconds)
```
CONTROL DEATH
They killed merit in schools.
Said standards were oppression.
Called excellence exclusion.
But parents fought back.
States acted.
Truth returned.

They tried controlling language.
Policing thoughts.
Forcing power.
But people chose freedom.

That's not inclusion.
That's resistance.
```

## Power Death (60 seconds)
```
FREEDOM WIN
Here's what they missed:
When you build control,
You build resistance.

When you force ideology,
You create opposition.

When you kill merit,
You birth excellence.

That's not justice.
That's power.
And power?
Power always falls to freedom.
```

## Victory Close (30 seconds)
```
TRUTH LIVES
Remember this:
Markets beat ideology.
Truth beats force.
Freedom beats control.
Reality always wins.

Always.
```
