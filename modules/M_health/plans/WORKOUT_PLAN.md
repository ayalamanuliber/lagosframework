### Current Phase Priority
1. **Form Mastery**
   - Perfect each movement pattern
   - Build mind-muscle connection
   - Establish consistent tempo

2. **Consistency**
   - 3x per week attendance
   - Fixed workout times
   - Regular recovery days

3. **Basic Progression**
   - Simple weight increases
   - Rep quality over quantity
   - Focus on feeling the muscle

## Progressive Overload Strategy üìà
1. **Weight Progression**
   - Increase when you can complete all sets with good form
   - Small jumps (2.5kg) for upper body
   - Larger jumps (5kg) for lower body

2. **Volume Progression**
   - Week 1-2: Base volume
   - Week 3: Add 1 set to main lifts
   - Week 4: Deload (reduce weight by 20%)

## Recovery Protocol üîÑ
### Active Recovery Days
- Light walking: 20-30 mins
- Mobility work: 10-15 mins
- Stretching: Focus on worked muscles

### Rest Days
- Sleep: 7-8 hours
- Hydration: 3L water minimum
- Protein: 1.6-2.0g/kg bodyweight

## Notes üìù
- Adjust weights based on energy levels
- Focus on mind-muscle connection
- Log any joint discomfort
- Track personal records (PRs)

Remember: Form > Weight > Volume
