# UBI Debate Rebuttal

The McKinsey report's 25% job disruption prediction actually undermines the case for UBI. Here's why: When we look at historical technological transitions, like the Industrial Revolution, job displacement was matched by job creation. The key difference? Targeted skill development programs.

Take Estonia's Digital Skills Initiative: They faced 30% potential automation in their workforce but achieved 82% successful job transitions through focused digital training and industry partnerships. This cost just 15% of what a national UBI would require. The solution isn't universal handouts - it's strategic investment in human capital.

Regarding the gig economy argument: Denmark's "Flexicurity" model proves there's a better way. By combining flexible labor markets with security through targeted support and training, they've achieved both innovation and stability. Their entrepreneurship rate is 28% higher than UBI-testing regions, while maintaining lower poverty rates.

The Stockton experiment, while interesting, had just 125 participants - hardly scalable evidence. Meanwhile, Singapore's SkillsFuture program has successfully transitioned over 500,000 workers to new industries with sustainable employment, not perpetual dependency.

The solution is precision, not universality. UBI is an expensive hammer treating every problem as a nail.
