- Card remains consistent across all topics (movies, games, comics, etc.)
- When someone hits all the buzzwords, they achieve "Peak Woke"
- Can be used for:
  - Movie reviews
  - Game critiques
  - Comic analysis
  - TV show breakdowns
  - Any cultural commentary

## Running Gag Elements
- Pedro keeps the same worn-out card
- Marks get more aggressive over time
- Sometimes pre-marks squares because "you know they're gonna say it"
- Occasionally mutters "bingo" under breath before they even finish talking
