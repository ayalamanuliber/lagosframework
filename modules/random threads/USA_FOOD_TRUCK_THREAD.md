ðŸ§µ How food trucks went from "roach coaches" to revolutionizing American dining, despite every city trying to stop them

A thread about how el mercado se impone, featuring Michelin-starred chefs in parking lots...

1/ 2008: The Great Recession hits.
â€¢ Restaurants closing
â€¢ Chefs unemployed
â€¢ Real estate costs skyrocketing
â€¢ Cities trying to "protect" traditional restaurants

The market said: "Hold my artisanal craft beer" ðŸšš

2/ Traditional restaurant math:
â€¢ Startup costs: $500k+
â€¢ Rent: $10k+/month
â€¢ Staff: 20+ people
â€¢ Permits: 6-12 months
â€¢ Success rate: 10%

Someone asked: "What if restaurant... but wheels?" 

3/ The NUMBERS were clear:
â€¢ Food truck: $50k
â€¢ No rent
â€¢ 3-4 staff
â€¢ Flexible locations
â€¢ Low overhead

Cities: "Absolutely not."
Market: "Watch this" ðŸ“ˆ

4/ Cities tried EVERYTHING to stop them:
â€¢ No parking >1 hour
â€¢ Can't be near restaurants
â€¢ Complex permit systems
â€¢ Restricted zones
â€¢ "Health concerns"

Result? The most innovative dining revolution in US history ðŸ”¥

5/ Chefs got CREATIVE:
â€¢ Twitter for locations
â€¢ Text alerts for daily spots
â€¢ Popup schedules
â€¢ Underground food festivals
â€¢ Parking lot fine dining

A Michelin-starred chef serving from a truck? In 2010, impossible. In 2023, Tuesday. ðŸŒ®

6/ The innovation was WILD:
â€¢ GPS tracking apps
â€¢ Real-time inventory
â€¢ Social media marketing
â€¢ Dynamic pricing
â€¢ Community-driven locations

Traditional restaurants: "That's not fair!"
Customers: "This is better" ðŸ“±

7/ The market spoke LOUD:
â€¢ 2008: ~3,000 food trucks
â€¢ 2023: 35,000+ trucks
â€¢ Average ROI: 300%
â€¢ Success rate: 40%
â€¢ Revenue: $1.2B industry

All while fighting regulations designed to kill them ðŸ’ª

8/ Best part? They IMPROVED cities:
â€¢ Activated dead spaces
â€¢ Created food destinations
â€¢ Launched new cuisines
â€¢ Built communities
â€¢ Proved old rules wrong

Cities now BEG food trucks to come to events they once banned them from ðŸ˜Ž

9/ Some WILD innovations:
â€¢ Truck-to-brick expansion
â€¢ Virtual food halls
â€¢ Mobile ghost kitchens
â€¢ Festival economies
â€¢ Popup restaurants

What started as a recession hack became the future of dining ðŸš€

10/ The regulation attempts got ABSURD:
â€¢ "No stopping on Tuesdays"
â€¢ "Must move every 30 mins"
â€¢ "500ft from any restaurant"
â€¢ "No social media posting"

Each new rule created 3 new innovations ðŸ§ 

11/ By 2020:
â€¢ Food trucks > New restaurants
â€¢ Truck chefs winning awards
â€¢ Cities changing laws
â€¢ "Traditional" restaurants adding trucks
â€¢ Even health inspectors eating there

12/ As one famous LA truck owner said:

"They tried to regulate us out of existence. Instead, we regulated them into irrelevance. Turns out good food wins, no matter where it comes from."

13/ The proof el mercado se impone:
â€¢ Cities: "No food trucks!"
â€¢ People: "Food trucks are better"
â€¢ Cities: "They're not real restaurants!"
â€¢ People: "They're better than restaurants"
â€¢ Cities: "Please come to our events?" 

14/ Remember folks:

You can regulate the trucks
But you can't regulate the hustle

El mercado se impone... one parking spot at a time ðŸšš
