# Manu's Quantum Routines 🎯

## Current Reality (As of Feb 2024)

### Work Structure
- Remote work: Bloodhound Investigations (Texas law firm)
- Core hours: 11:00-19:00 
- Role: Research department

### Current Pattern
```
Morning:
- Variable wake time
- Dog walking (needs consistency)
- Work starts 11:00

Day:
- Research work 11:00-19:00
- Occasional gym sessions
- Mixed soccer at 19:00 (specific days)

Evening:
- Variable sleep time
- Often late-night productivity
```

### Current Challenges
- Sleep schedule inconsistency
- Gym attendance sporadic
- Morning routine not optimized

## Quantum Ideal State 🌟

### Morning Optimization
```
06:30 - Wake up (non-negotiable)
06:35 - Morning sun + Dog walk
07:15 - Return home
07:30 - Protein breakfast
08:00 - Coffee (Huberman protocol)
08:00-11:00 - Personal empire building
```

### Work Integration
```
11:00-19:00 - Bloodhound core hours
- Strategic breaks
- Time zone advantage usage
```

### Evening Protocol
```
19:00-22:30 - Quantum freedom block
- Gym/Soccer
- Personal projects
- Network building
22:30 - Wind down
23:00 - Sleep
```

## Implementation Progress

### Currently Testing ⚗️
- Morning sun exposure
- Consistent wake time
- Gym alternating days

### Quantum Wins 🏆
- Remote work optimization
- Soccer commitment
- Dog walking routine

### Next Targets 🎯
- LinkedIn presence
- Network optimization
- Contact list cleanup

## Notes for Cascade
- User works from home (advantage)
- Has direct line to Tronco
- Building personal business alongside work
- Enjoys late-night productivity but wants better structure
- Dog needs morning walk (can combine with Huberman sun protocol)
