The Day Our AI Became Obsessed With My Coffee Mug

Look, I'm not saying I broke our computer vision system with my coffee addiction. But also... I totally broke our computer vision system with my coffee addiction.

It's actually kind of impressive how one dirty coffee mug can bring down an entire AI image recognition pipeline. Though my team lead probably wouldn't use the word "impressive."

Let me explain.

We were building this fancy image recognition system for a retail client. You know the type - point your phone at a product, get all the details, very future-is-now stuff. TensorFlow, ResNet backbone, custom object detection heads, the whole shebang. My baby.

The training was going great. 97.3% accuracy on the test set. Clean confusion matrices. Beautiful precision-recall curves. That kind of project where you start practicing your conference talk in the shower.

Then came The Mug.

See, I have this habit of keeping my coffee mug in frame while I'm debugging. It's this massive thing with circuit board patterns that I got at a hackathon. Real developer aestheticâ„¢. And I tend to... forget about it.

So there I was, running another training batch at 3 AM (because when else do you train models?), webcam on for monitoring the training dashboard. My mug, faithful companion that it is, sitting right there in frame.

For six hours.

In the same spot.

While I was feeding thousands of product images through the system.

Did you know that if a neural network sees the same object in the background of enough training images, it starts thinking that object is... important?

Yeah. Neither did I.

First sign something was wrong: our model started detecting coffee mugs in pictures that definitely didn't have coffee mugs. Like, "Sorry, I can't identify that laptop because I'm too distracted by the coffee mug that isn't there" kind of wrong.

Product team: "Here's a smartphone."
AI: "Interesting angle of a coffee mug."
Product team: "No, it's the new iPhone."
AI: "Ah, I see the confusion. It's actually a very shiny coffee mug."

But it gets better.

The model didn't just see coffee mugs everywhere - it had become a coffee mug CONNOISSEUR. Started classifying non-existent mugs by style and probable coffee content:

"Vintage ceramic mug, likely containing single-origin Ethiopian beans, notes of bergamot."
"Modern minimalist mug, approximately 73% full of what appears to be an americano."
"IKEA VARDAGEN mug circa 2019, tragically empty."

This last one was actually about a potted plant.

My favorite bug report came from the UX team:
"Model keeps warning users their coffee is getting cold. There is no coffee in the test image. Image is of a tennis ball."

Turns out my mug had appeared in exactly 12,487 training images. Always in the same spot. Always with varying levels of coffee. The model had basically written a doctoral thesis on coffee mug analytics instead of learning product recognition.

The fix wasn't even hard - just had to clean the training data and retrain. But try explaining to your project manager why you need two extra days because "the AI got really into coffee."

We did eventually get it working properly. Though sometimes, when the lighting is just right, it still gets a bit... wistful about coffee mugs.

The whole thing is now immortalized in our team's coding guidelines:
"Rule 17: No beverage containers in frame during training. Yes, this is because of That One Time."

I switched to a water bottle after that. Clear, minimal, no interesting patterns.

Though lately our model's been making some interesting observations about hydration habits...
